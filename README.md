# astrometry
Correction of the HST astrometry in the GOODS-South Field. This work take into account a global offset $\Delta$RA\,=\,-96$\pm$83 mas and $\Delta$Dec\,=\,252$\pm$107 mas and a distortion offset that was artificially introduced in the process of building the mosaic of the GOODS-South HST image. The CANDELS ID and coordinates (col1, col2 and col3) are from [Guo et al. (2013)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/207/2/24/pdf). The new coordinates corrected from these offsets are given in col4 and col5.
If you use this data for your published or presented work, please reference Franco et al. 2020a. Thanks!
